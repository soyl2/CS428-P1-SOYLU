# CS428-P1-SOYLU

## INTRO

This is my first project for the CS428: Augmented and Virtual Reality course
UIC. I used Unity with Vuforia to create two AR knickknacks, similar to the
kinds of trinkets one can buy at gift shops to remind you of the place you
visited. The two destinations I chose were Kennedy Space Center in Florida,
USA, and the Golden Bridge in Da Nang, Vietnam.

## HOW TO USE

REQUIREMENTS:
Unity Editor 2021.3.6f1
Vuforia 10.10
A working webcam

To view the knickknacks yourself, you can download the codebase from github.

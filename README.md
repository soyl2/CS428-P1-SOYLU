# CS428-P1-SOYLU

### INTRO

This is my first project for the CS428: Augmented and Virtual Reality course at UIC. I used Unity with Vuforia to create two AR knickknacks, similar to the kinds of trinkets one can buy at gift shops to remind you of the place you visited. The two destinations I chose were Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA, and the Golden Bridge in Da Nang, Vietnam.

### HOW TO USE

###### REQUIREMENTS:
- Unity Editor 2021.3.6f1
- Vuforia 10.10 (should come with the source code)
- A working webcam
- Two little Vuforia cubes

To view the knickknacks yourself, you can download the codebase from github.

###### Installing Unity:
Download Unity hub. Go to archive. Download that specific version.

Next,  open the folder in unity.
You should have this scene.[pic]

Press play. Holding up the Merge cube should show x and the other cube should show Y.

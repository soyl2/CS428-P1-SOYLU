# CS428-P1-SOYLU

### INTRO

This is my first project for the CS428: Augmented and Virtual Reality course at UIC. I used Unity with Vuforia to create two AR knickknacks, similar to the kinds of trinkets one can buy at gift shops to remind you of the place you visited. The two destinations I chose were Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA, and the Golden Bridge in Da Nang, Vietnam.

### HOW TO USE

Please make sure to first install Unity Editor version 2021.3.6f1, and build the two papercraft Vuforia cubes.

###### REQUIREMENTS:
- Unity Editor 2021.3.6f1
- Vuforia 10.10 (should come with the source code)
- A working webcam
- Two little Vuforia cubes

###### Viewing the knickknacks in Unity
To view the knickknacks yourself, you can download the projects source code from the github page.

Unzip this file into the directory of your choice. 

In the upper right corner of the Projects tab of Unity Hub, click 'Open'.

The project should now be visible in the list. Make sure the correct Editor version is selected.

Click on the project to open it in Unity Editor. It may take a while to load, but once it is open, you should see the two cubes in the scene.
To view the cubes in AR mode, press the play button in the upper part of the window.

This will open your webcam, and you will be able to view the knickknacks by holding up the two Vuforia cubes you painstakingly built earlier.
